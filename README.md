## Description
For this program, once executed it will display a block of text welcoming and informing the customer of what is avaliable to order. Then prompts the user to enter how many portions of bread they wish to order, reads the users input then asks how many pastries they wish to order.  The backend of the program will then pass those inputs along to their respective class methods and determine the final price after deals are included and then informs the user what it is.
